
OpenBOR
----------------------
OpenBOR is a continuation of Beats Of Rage originally created by the wonderful
folks over at http://www.senileteam.com


History
----------------------
As fans of the 'Streets of Rage' series that originally appeared on the SEGA 
megadrive/genesis, we always wanted to see streets of rage 4. But the waiting 
proved futile, and streets of rage 4 never came. That's why we tried to correct 
this mistake and fill the void by making the ultimate tribute to Streets of Rage:
Beats of Rage!! 


Development
----------------------
Beats of Rage was created by Senile Team. However, the character sprites and 
some parts of the backgrounds are taken from 'the King of Fighters' games by 
SNK Playmore. Therefore special thanks go out to SNK Playmore and SEGA who 
unknowingly helped in creating this game.

Beats of Rage and OpenBOR are a free, fully functional game, which includes 
music, and features six playable levels plus a bonus level. It is available 
for many systems, including:

PC, Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Xbox, PSP, PS3, Linux, Windows, GP32, and Palmtop.


The DOS version can also be used on Windows 95 and Windows 98.

The City Is In Danger
----------------------
It's been three months since his escape. But in this time mr. Y has brought 
the city into turmoil. He has taken control over the city's government and 
corrupted its police force. No one is safe and thugs and villains rule the 
streets. But three young friends take a stand for great justice. Their names 
are Kula Gem, Max Bacon and Mandy Bluegard. No longer can they tolerate crime, 
violence and injustice. So they go out into the streets to deliver some.... 
Beats of Rage



Fight!
----------------------
Fight the injustice that plagues this city, and take control of one of the 
three heroes. Start delivering those beats in this side-way scrolling beat 'em up, 
in single player mode or with two players simultaneously.
